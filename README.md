# Hello, I'm Glynn! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me ðŸš€
I'm a Solutions Engineer with a passion for learning all things relevant to bettering the world, and doing my best to do this wielding JavaScript and AI tools. When I'm not coding, you can find me traveling, learning Spanish, playing basketball, or finding new music to listen to! (If you want some AWESOME playlists, let me know)

## My Work ðŸ’»
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at BigCommerce, especially on NextJS and utilizing various AI tools, especially through API services.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NextJS and various AI tools at work, and Spanish outside of work!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on lightweight AI projects (for the time being).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about BigCommerce! That's probably where I could help you the most at the moment.
